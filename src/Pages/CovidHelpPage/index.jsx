          <h3>Mental health coaching for those with heightened anxiety and depression</h3>
          <p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, over 20% of the African population was estimated to have mental illness. At mDoc, our surveys have revealed 25-30% of the population we serve has mental health needs and we believe this number will exponentially rise as COVID-19 wreaks more havoc on our healthcare systems and economies in Africa. <br /><br />We are ramping up a dedicated mental health online consultation support service to people who need help with anxiety and depression.</p>

          <p>We conduct monthly tele-education (ECHO) capacity building sessions aimed at healthcare providers that strive to improve the quality of patient care. <br /><br />This tool has provided an invaluable platform to educate healthcare professionals on clinical practices that would reduce their exposure to COVID-19 as well as improve their ability to identify cases and to better manage suspected cases. We have recently opened up a regular tele-education series for pregnant women on COVID-19 in pregnancy.</p>
